# pandoc-improved-figures

This brings improved figures to pandoc as a filter.

You can add the `short-caption="XXX"` attribute to figures to add a short caption.

You can also add `.margin` or `.wide` to create margin figures or wide figures respectively. NB: This requires `\usepackage{sidenote}` in the `header-includes` of your file.
